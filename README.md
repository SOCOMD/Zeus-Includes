# Zeus Includes

This repo houses the up-to-date Zeus includes for SOCOMD and how to create your mission with the includes.

## How to make an operation
### Step one: Create your mission
Make your mission in game. Set up your objectives, place the friendly units and enemy.
Ensure that you download the correct composition [HERE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3423995559) & [LHD Composition](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3381349712) for the latest Arsenal boxes as well.
Save the mission once you have done all of this.

### Step Two: Includes
1. Download the latest includes, located in this Github repo. [Link here](https://github.com/SOCOMD/Zeus-Includes/releases/tag/main)
2. Place ALL files and folders into your mission folder.
3. Make relevant changes to the `details.hpp` file. Eg, Mission name, Author etc.
4. Load your mission in the editor once again to ensure that the mission is working.
5. Export the mission to PBO.

### Step Three: Upload and Test
1. Once you have your PBO, upload the mission file to the mission sync folder in the member file centre channel in TeamSpeak.
2. Notify J4 with what mods you are running for your mission and ask to start the server.
3. Load into the server and load the correct mission file.
4. Test to ensure that all of the places units and equipment are present with no major errors.
5. Report that you have tested the mission

### You are now ready for the operation on Friday night.
